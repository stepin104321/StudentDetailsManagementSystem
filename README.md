Student Details Management System
Every school, college and educational institute maintains a database of student data as they will be requiring it frequently for various purposes. 
Earlier this was done manually by maintaining handwritten registers, which is not a very good technique as it may incur many errors and lead to time wastage. 
Nowadays, every application is being digitized in order to make things easy for us. So, this mini-project aims at digitizing the traditional students register 
and successfully provide an efficient performance.
